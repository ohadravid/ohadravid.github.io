A few of the things I worked on can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ohadravid).

## wmi-rs
[wmi-rs](https://github.com/ohadravid/wmi-rs) is a Rust crate for querying Window's WMI, using `serde` to auto-generate SQL-like queries and deserialize the results.

## netstat2-rs
[netstat2-rs](https://github.com/ohadravid/netstat2-rs) is a Rust crate that can be used to retrieve network sockets information, using APIs provided by the OS, on Windows, Linux and macOS. \
It is a fork of the older `netstat` Rust crate, which is no longer maintained.

## Seminar on Sphere Packing in Dimension 8
As part of an undergraduate seminar for my BS in Math and CompSci, I wrote a detailed explanation of Maryna Viazovska landmark 2016 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04246) "The sphere packing problem in dimension 8".

The work assumes only undergraduate-level knowledge of mathematics (mainly linear algebra and complex analysis), and is written in [`typst`](https://typst.app/).

The sources and the rendered PDFs are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ohadravid/sphere-packing-in-8dims).
