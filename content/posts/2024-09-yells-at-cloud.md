Sometimes, I get mad at someone on the internet.

It‚Äôs just so easy, isn‚Äôt it?

Then, I remember my most downvoted StackOverflow answer, and I become less angry.

I wrote the actual answer many years ago, but the angry-ness is much more recent.

Apparently, I angered someone on a topic that is _so_ controversial that my answer became part of a [StackOverflow Meta](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/)(!) [discussion](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/420337/what-is-the-procedure-for-getting-blatantly-off-topic-c-or-c-answers-deleted) about how to deal with such terrible answers.

The question was never tagged C++ yet the answer only applies to C++. The score is +18 -5 = 13 currently.

> What should be done with such answers?

Damn, was someone mad at me on the internet.

(Edit: the answer is now deleted! thanks HN üòÇ [archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20231203060623/https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37538/how-do-i-determine-the-size-of-my-array-in-c/8129291#8129291))

When I wrote that answer (13 years ago, but only  \**checks-notes*\* 11 years before the meta-discussion ü´†), I needed to know the size of an array in a C thing I was working on, and the top answer(s) (`sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0])`) didn‚Äôt apply.

However! My C thing was actually a C/C++ thing, so I wrote my answer (== can‚Äôt be done, if C++ then use `vector`[^1]), went on with my life and forgot all about it.

Until I saw this notification:

> How do I determine the size of my array in C? \
> For those with <1k rep: This answer has +32/-33 votes.

Wat 

Apparently, I stepped (through time and space) right into one of the most fiery subjects on SO (a site not known for calm and respectable discourse at the best of times): 

**Are C and C++ two completely different languages?**

And, look. I don‚Äôt know. Obviously I wasn‚Äôt a C or a C++ expert then, am not one now and not even on the path of becoming one. I don‚Äôt have an opinion on this matter. 

But I was just starting out, and if someone wrote that my answer was _so_ bad that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs little hope to delete-vote it‚Äù, I would probably be super sad.

So try to be excellent to each other on the internet. It‚Äôs so easy to be angry, but it can be just as easy to let go of your anger when you know others are probably more angry at you all the time.

I‚Äôll end this with a [reddit classic](https://www.reddit.com/r/meirl/comments/13igqv4/meirl/) that drives this point home more than anything I could ever hope to write:
