Whenever I get into a new technology (A new database feature, a fancy distributed queue, a programming language, an orchestration system, ...), 
I try to build myself a _mental model_ of how it works, so I can reason about how it should behave, predict its scaling properties, and avoid running expensive experiments.

Today, we'll build a mental model for _Full Text Search_ engines (along with some code in Rust), as done in database systems such as Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL and ClickHouse[^1],
and use it to explain and predict some key features, limitations, and solutions common across these systems. 

[^1]: As we are going to see, a good model will tradeoff precision for simplicity and generalization in order to cover different implementations of a single underlying idea.

## A Primer on Text Analysis

Consider the following example. Say we have a few documents, each describing a programming language:

| Name       | Description                                                                                                             |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Python     | Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.                     |
| TypeScript | TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.  |
| Rust       | Rust is a statically-typed programming language designed for performance and safety.                                    |

Full text search boils down to this: given a query like `performant typed language`, find:
(a) *which* documents match the query and 
(b) *rank* them by how well they match the query.

Let's write a minimal implementation that can answer these questions, and use that to predict how a real system might behave. \
We'll set up our code so that we have this data in memory, and ignore the many details required to actually store it [safely on disk](https://danluu.com/file-consistency/).

```rust
let docs = [
    "Python .. lets you work quickly ..",
    "TypeScript .. builds on JavaScript  ..",
    "Rust is .. designed for performance and safety ..",
    "C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot .."
];

type DocId = usize;
```

## A Simple Tokenizer

We'll start by **breaking** each long piece of text into small atoms, called _tokens_[^2], which are going to be the individual words that make up the original text.

[^2]: Not to be confused with _tokens in the LLM sense_, which are sequences of characters that are mapped to a specific number in an embedding space, and can be parts of words (See for example: [Tiktokenizer](https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app/), and `openai/tiktoken`'s [BPEs](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-bpe-anyway)).

The simplest way to do this is by splitting every time we see a whitespace character, which is a single line of code in most languages:

```rust
fn tokenize(doc: &str) -> Vec<&str> {
    doc.split_ascii_whitespace().collect()
}

let doc = "Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.";

// Prints `["Python", "is", "a", "programming", .. , "effectively."]`.
dbg!(tokenize(doc));
```

Phew! Some 10x engineering right there. 
However, I failed to mention _why_ we are actually breaking down the text.

## An Inverted Index

To look for documents matching the query `performant typed language`, we can check for each token _in the query_ to see if it's contained in each of the documents.
A query token is usually called a _term_.

Instead of scanning every document for every token we will _tokenize the documents_ and store the tokens from each document in an _inverted index_:
the token will be the key, and the value will be the document ids that contain that token.

| token       | docs ids    |
|-------------|-------------|
| better      | [1]         |
| concurrency | [2]         |
| typed       | [1, 2]      |
| language    | [0, 1, 2]   |
| performance | [2]         |
| ..          | ..          |

There's a small wrinkle here because `performant` and `performance` are not the same token, which we'll handle in the next section.

It's worth noting that simply splitting a text by whitespace characters will not produce what we think of as tokens for more general texts, 
but for now this is good enough.

## BTrees, the Powerhouse of the Database

We are going to use [`BTreeMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html) from the standard library as the data structure for our index.

For a _mental model_ of a full text search engine, we can treat all the minutiae around binary trees, b-trees, b+trees, etc. as, well, minutiae, 
and _think_ about the `BTreeMap` index as a **stored array with cheap insert/remove**, with values attached to the sorted elements - just like the table above.[^3]

[^3]: Sorted arrays have cheap (in the `O(log(N))` sense) lookup using binary search, so we are getting this "for free" here.

This is _technically_ completely incorrect, but it's a very useful **approximation**. When working out a mental model, having a good approximation and knowing _when_ that approximation doesn't apply can be more useful than hauling out the precise formulation for every analysis.

Bonus content: when is this approximation likely to fail?[^4]

[^4]: Most notably, keeping the tree balanced (during insert and delete operations) is complex enough that most implementations will run compactions at certain intervals and only mark a node as deleted without actually removing it. 
Also, the actual relationship between the on-disk and in-memory representations (and how fast it is to load from / spill over to the disk) can have operational consequences.

The reason we want to think about a _map_ as a sorted array/table is because we'll be working with ranges. In our little example, `performant` and `performance` aren't the same token, but they do share a **stem**: if we stemmed the query and got back something like `perform`, we can use our inverted index to get all the tokens starting with `perform` efficiently by binary-searching for it, and then advancing along the values of the index.

Let's whip up a small Rust implementation which will allow us to reason about some of the typical features full text search implementations have.

```rust
// Create a new index.
let mut index: BTreeMap<String, Vec<DocId>> = BTreeMap::new();

for (doc_id, doc) in docs.iter().enumerate() {
    let tokens = tokenize(doc);

    // Insert each token into the index, with the document id added to the value.
    for token in tokens {
        index
            .entry(token.to_string())
            .or_insert_with(|| vec![])
            .push(doc_id);
    }
}

// Prints `{"C": [3], "JavaScript,": [1], "Python": [0], "Rust": [2], "TypeScript": [1], .. }`.
dbg!(&index);
```

The call to `or_insert_with` will insert an empty `Vec` into the index for the `token` key if it's missing, and return the `Vec` (either the newly created one or the existing one) so we can `push` the `doc_id` into it.

Querying the index by key is simpler but we won't get any result for the `perform` term:

```rust
let original_query = tokenize("performant typed language");
// .. stemmed each term of the query, for example using a dictionary ..
let query = ["perform", "typed", "language"];

dbg!(index.get(query[0])); // None
dbg!(index.get(query[1])); // Some([1, 2])
dbg!(index.get(query[2])); // Some([0, 1, 2])
```

This brings us to the other way to query the `BTreeMap`, and the reason it's useful to approximate it as a sorted array: 
we can query it efficiently (in the `O(log(N))` sense) by _range_, which for `String`s will use lexicographic order:

```rust
let term = "perform".to_string();
for (key, value) in index.range(term..) {
    // key = "performance", value = [2]
    // key = "programming", value = [0, 1, 2]
    // ...
    dbg!(key, value);
}
```

Calculating the matching docs can be done by taking an intersection of all the docs ids returned for each term. See [Appx. 1](#appendix-1---compared-to-naive-search) for some additional perf analysis.

### Ranking

When searching for text in a large corpus, it's common to only want to return the "best" N results, as there are likely many more documents matching any given query than are useful for the user.

To meaningfully rank our results we need more data, but we can already build some intuition: We can see that if we count the total number of documents that contain each token, we see that `performance` (1) < `typed` (2) < `language` (3). We can deduce that `performance` is a more "specific" token, meaning that documents that contain it (especially multiple times) would be a better match for the query. 

This idea is called [tf–idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf), or `term frequency-inverse document frequency`, and for our mental model it is enough that we think about it as "we also need to store some statistics about our corpus" in order to perform **basic** ranking. 

For example, Elasticsearch uses [BM25](https://www.elastic.co/blog/practical-bm25-part-2-the-bm25-algorithm-and-its-variables) by default, which is an advanced tf-idf-like ranking function. PostgreSQL has two ranking functions [`ts_rank` and `ts_rank_cd`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-controls.html#TEXTSEARCH-RANKING), and both are based on term frequency.

## Four Features and a Funeral 

Despite being frugal, we can use this model to predict some interesting properties a full text search system will have:

🔪 **Sharding** is almost free: \
Splitting documents across nodes in a cluster is straightforward with this architecture. Each node can perform text analysis and indexing [independently](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-replication.html#basic-write-model), so a system can scale horizontally. 

However, our model also reveals a tradeoff: when executing queries, each node will need to return the top N matches (not knowing what other nodes have found), and a single node (or the client) will need to rank the final results. Our model also shows that the longer the query (or, more precisely, the number of terms in the processed query), the more work the database will need to do to execute it - each term requires a lookup and an intersection operation. 

#️⃣ **Prefix** search is free, general wildcards are not: \
Our model shows that executing a prefix query like `python lang*` is essentially free: we can use the same `range` operation on the index to get the matching documents. \
Implementing **postfix** search can be done by reversing each token and index it a second time in a separate index, doubling the storage requirements. 

For example, Elasticsearch supports [`prefix` queries](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-prefix-query.html) which are just as fast as regular queries, and has a built-in [`reverse`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-reverse-tokenfilter.html) option to index reversed tokens, and PostgreSQL supports prefix queries using a syntax like `lang:*` that can be passed to [`::tsquery`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-textsearch.html#DATATYPE-TSQUERY).

But we can see from our model that supporting queries like `*ython* language` is a lot harder! To do it efficiently, we can use [_n-grams_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram), which is like applying a sliding window tokenizer to the original text, and will increase the index size a lot. Elasticsearch has an [`ngram`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-ngram-tokenizer.html) tokenizer, and ClickHouse supports `ngrams` via the [`full_text(ngrams)`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/invertedindexes#usage) index creation option.

📊 The **Common tokens** problem: \
Our model predicts that common tokens like `the` and `a` will require storing an enormous number of document ids, but they are almost useless for searching and ranking documents (counterpoint: consider a query like `bear` vs `The Bear`). Handling them specifically (together with stemming and tokenizing) requires [language specific](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-lang-analyzer.html) knowledge.

Regular terms also tend to have an uneven distribution, with some (like `language` in our little example) being pretty common, and a lot of terms being very rare. We used a vector to store the document ids, which will be inefficient at both ends of this spectrum, so we can predict that different implementations will choose different underlying data structures for them: For example, ClickHouse uses [roaring bitmaps](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-search-with-inverted-indices#posting-lists) while PostgreSQL uses [`GIN`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-indexes.html#TEXTSEARCH-INDEXES) which is [implemented](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/gin.html#GIN-IMPLEMENTATION) as a B-tree of B-trees.

✂️ The **Multi-Field Filtering** Challenge: \
When users want to combine text search with structured filters (`"typescript btree" AND stars > 1000`), our model points to a problem: unless we create a dedicated index that uses both fields, we'll have to get all the doc ids matching the text and intersect them with the doc ids that match the other filter(s). PostgreSQL supports this via [multicolumn GIN indices](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-multicolumn.html), while Elasticsearch doesn't support creating such indices but instead focuses on having a very efficient intersection implementation.

🔴 Despite being super useful, there are two related features that are supported by most full text search engines, but are hard to support with our current model: highlights and followed-by queries. But not all is lost! By extending our model a little bit, we can solve these limitations elegantly.

## A Position is Worth a Thousand Cycles

Consider a query like `javascript language`: since the TypeScript document has tokens matching both terms, we will consider it a match for this query.
We can let the user specify that they want a more "exact" match, for example by using `"javascript language"`, meaning that the term `language` must _follow_ the term `javascript`.

However, in our current model, to support this we'll need to **re-process** every document that matched the terms, and figure out at what order they appear.

This can be absolutely fine! Our example documents are very short, and if we don't expect an exact query to match a lot of documents (or don't intend to support them at all), doing this extra work isn't that bad.

A similar analysis applies for generating highlights for our results:

> Query: `performant typed language` \
> Response: `rust`: "Rust is a statically-**typed** programming **language** designed for **performance** and safety."

Doing this "on the fly" for short documents can be fine, but if we had bigger documents (e.g. entire Wikipedia articles), we’ll end up paying a high compute cost for each query.

The key insight is that we need to know not just _which_ documents contain the terms, but _where_ those terms appear in each document.
We can do that by trading query-time compute with ingest-time compute and storage: 
instead of only storing the document **ids** for each token, we can also store its offsets in the document!

This will require us to re-structure both our index and tokenizer. 

We'll define a struct to hold the start and end offsets of a term:

```rust
type DocId = usize;

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct TokenOffsets(usize, usize);
```

Returning a huge `Vec` is actually bad for performance, so we'll also let the tokenizer insert each token into the index.

We _could_ implement a small `struct` for the iteration and generation of tokens and offsets, but that require a significant amount of Rust-fu which is pretty irrelevant to our little experiment (you can peruse such an implementation at your leisure in [Appx. 2](#appendix-2---a-token-iterator-in-rustt)).

```rust
fn tokenize_and_insert(
    doc_id: usize,
    doc: &str,
    index: &mut BTreeMap<String, Vec<(usize, TokenOffsets)>>,
) {
    // .. snip ..
}
```

We'll track the current term's offsets using the new structure, and update it as we iterate over the document:

```rust
let split_chars = HashSet::from([' ', '-', '.', ',']);

let mut token_offsets = TokenOffsets(0, 0);

for (char_offset, char) in doc.chars().enumerate() {
    if split_chars.contains(&char) {
        token_offsets.1 = char_offset;
        
        // Get the slice of `doc` for the token offsets.
        let token = &doc[token_offsets.0..token_offsets.1];

        index
            .entry(token.to_ascii_lowercase())
            .or_insert_with(|| vec![])
            // This time, we store both the doc id and the offsets as values.
            .push((doc_id, token_offsets));
        
        // The next token will start at the next character.
        token_offsets = TokenOffsets(char_offset + 1, char_offset + 1);
    }
}
```

The result is that for a query like `"javascript language"` we get:

```rust
let query = ["javascript", "language"];

dbg!(index.get(query[0])); // Some([(1, TokenOffsets(67, 77))])
dbg!(index.get(query[1])); // Some([ .. ,  (1, TokenOffsets(43, 51)), .. ]
```

And since 67 > 43, we know that the document doesn't match the query, without accessing the original text!

Storing the token's offsets will allow us to do highlighting very quickly but will use a lot more storage. We could also use the _order_ of the tokens (i.e. 1, 2, 3, ..) 
which still allows us to perform follow-by queries efficiently, while using something like a `u16` to store the order (usually called `position`) in the index.

Another benefit of using positions is that we can support queries with "slop", meaning a query can allow some number of other tokens in the document between the query's terms.

For example, Elasticsearch provides a few different [`index_options`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-options.html) for text fields: 
storing only the document ids, storing `positions` (the order of tokens in the document), or storing `offsets` (the actual offset of the token, for faster highlighting, as well as positions), and can [highlight](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/highlighting.html) fields indexed in any of them (for a compute cost when executing the query). The [`match_phrase`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-match-query-phrase.html) query supports a `slop` parameter.

PostgreSQL's `ts_vector` stores tokens and positions and queries support a special syntax (`<N>`) for followed-by with a specified slop, and has a [limitation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-limitations.html) of 16,383 positions per vector. 
PostgreSQL also provides the [`ts_headline`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-controls.html#TEXTSEARCH-HEADLINE) function, but notes that it "uses the original document, not a `tsvector` summary, so it can be slow and should be used with care".

## Summary

That's it folks! We have a model of a full text search engine - it boils down to splitting text into tokens, storing tokens in a sorted index with their document id and position, and fetching by prefix. \
We even saw that the predictions we made based on this model matched the behaviors and documentation of different implementations.

I used this model _a lot_ back when I was working with big Elasticsearch clusters and needed to implement complex queries, custom mappings, and analyzers, 
and it helped me to better understand everything about the system and the things we observed when putting it under pressure.

Sometimes, to build an accurate enough model of a system, it can be enough to _do the reading_: 
the documentation, design documents, and technical articles might provide all the information you'll need, 
but it can be easy to get lost in the details, and a small amount of code can help you stay focused on the most important parts.

Are there any particularly useful mental models you have? Discuss on [r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/), [lobsters](https://lobste.rs/)! 👋

## Appendix 1 - Compared to Naive Search

We can compare our index to a naive search strategy: look for each term by scanning all the documents over and over.

To isolate the interesting parts, we'll skip returning the `Vec` with the document ids (which, as we saw, was the least realistic part of the implementation anyway).

We'll use [Criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) to do the benchmarking.

Our naive search is simply:

```rust
fn search_using_str_find(query: &[&str], docs: &[&str]) {
    for &term in query {
        for (doc_id, doc) in docs.iter().enumerate() {
            if doc.find(term).is_some() {
                black_box(doc_id);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

While our index-based search will use:

```rust
fn search_using_index(query: &[&str], index: &BTreeMap<&str, Vec<DocId>>) {
    for &term in query {
        let (key, value) = index.range(term..).next().unwrap();

        if !key.starts_with(term) {
            continue;
        }

        black_box(value);
    }
}
```

Note that we're using a slightly different index type here: Instead of using a `String` (heap-allocated vector of chars) key, we are using `&str` (a slice of chars). This is more realistic and allows us to remove an annoying allocation which would make the benchmark useless.

Using the same query as before, we can add a few more documents to see how performance is affected by more data.
```rust
let query = ["perform", "typed", "language"];
let docs = [
    "Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.",
    "TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.",
    "Rust is a statically-typed programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency and memory management.",
    "C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot. C++ makes it harder, but when you do, you blow your whole leg off.",
    "Java is a class-based, object-oriented language that is designed to be portable, secure, and run on billions of devices.",
    "Go is a simple, statically typed language designed by Google for efficient concurrency and fast compilation.",
    "JavaScript is the language of the web, enabling interactive frontends and full-stack development with Node.js.",
    "Kotlin is a modern language that runs on the JVM and is fully interoperable with Java, with cleaner syntax and null safety.",
    "Swift is Apple's language for iOS and macOS development, designed for safety, speed, and modern features.",
    "PHP is a server-side scripting language especially suited to web development, powering WordPress and much of the internet.",
];
```

And running our benchmarks:

```rust
c.bench_function("search using str find with 4 documents", |b| {
    b.iter(|| search_using_str_find(&query, &docs[..4]))
});

c.bench_function("search using str find with 10 documents", |b| {
    b.iter(|| search_using_str_find(&query, &docs))
});

c.bench_function("search using index with 4 documents", |b| {
    let index = build_index(&docs[..4]);
    b.iter(|| search_using_index(&query, &index))
});

c.bench_function("search using index with 10 documents", |b| {
    let index = build_index(&docs);
    b.iter(|| search_using_index(&query, &index))
});
```

Results in:

```bash
search using str find with 4 documents
                        time:   [398.36 ns 400.39 ns 403.18 ns]

search using str find with 10 documents
                        time:   [995.03 ns 1.0005 µs 1.0067 µs]

search using index with 4 documents
                        time:   [122.27 ns 122.74 ns 123.30 ns]

search using index with 10 documents
                        time:   [110.82 ns 112.13 ns 113.97 ns]
```

Which matches our expectations: naive search scales linearly with the number of documents, and is always slower than using an index (which is barely affected by the small increase in data).

## Appendix 2 - A Token Iterator in Rust

My kingdom for a `yield` keyword in Rust[^5]. But until then, setting up an iterator that returns offsets of tokens isn't too bad.

We can even get away with a single lifetime, and tracking a single additional variable for the current offset in the document:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct TokenOffsets(usize, usize);

struct TokenOffsetsIter<'a> {
    doc: &'a str,
    current_offset: usize,
    split_chars: &'a HashSet<char>,
}

impl<'a> Iterator for TokenOffsetsIter<'a> {
    type Item = TokenOffsets;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        for (char_offset, char) in self.doc.chars().enumerate().skip(self.current_offset) {
            if self.split_chars.contains(&char) {
                let token_offsets = TokenOffsets(self.current_offset, char_offset);

                self.current_offset = char_offset + 1;

                return Some(token_offsets);
            }
        }

        None
    }
}
```
