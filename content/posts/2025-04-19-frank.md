Inspired by [a recent post](https://blog.glyph.im/2025/04/stop-writing-init-methods.html) about the woes of `__init__` methods in Python, 
I thought I’d share the untold story of the absolute craziest  `__init__` I’ve come across in a production codebase.

It all started when I tried to [add a failing test] to a Python service.

[add a failing test]: https://matklad.github.io/2023/12/31/git-things.html#Git-Things:~:text=When%20fixing%20a%20bug%2C%20add%20a%20failing%20test%20first%2C%20as%20a%20separate%20commit.%20That%20way%20it%20becomes%20easy%20to%20verify%20for%20anyone%20that%20the%20test%20indeed%20fails%20without%20the%20follow%20up%20fix.

The test was indeed failing, but every now and then it would fail on something unexpected.

## The Evidence of the Test

After some minimization, this was the test I had:

```python
def test_foobar():
    f = FooBarWidget()

    with contextlib.closing(f):
        assert False
```

which _sometimes_ failed with this error:

```python
self = <foobar.FooBarWidget object at 0x10512ed80>

    def close(self):
>       if self.should_exit is False:
E       AttributeError: 'FooBarWidget' object has no attribute 'should_exit'

foo.py:28: AttributeError
```

And not (only) the expected `AssertionError`.

Searching for `self.should_exit =` yielded `FooWidget.__init__` in `foo.py`:

```python
class AbstractWidget:
    def __init__(self):
        self.config = Path("config.json").read_text()

class FooWidget(AbstractWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        self.ctx = zmq.Context.instance()
        self.consumer: zmq.Socket = self.ctx.socket(zmq.PULL)
        self.should_exit = False

    def run(self):
        while self.should_exit is False:
            ...

        self.consumer.close()

    def close(self):
        if self.should_exit is False:
            self.should_exit = True
```

Which didn't make sense at all: assuming none of these lines fail, how can the `should_exit` attribute _sometimes_ not be to set?

## The `__init__`

The only other clue we have is that `self` is a `FooBarWidget`, not a `FooWidget`.
So, to the `class FooBarWidget(FooWidget)` definition I went, which is where I found it. 

The craziest `__init__` I've ever seen:

```python
class FooBarWidget(FooWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        self.publisher: zmq.Socket = zmq.Context.instance().socket(zmq.PUSH)

        self._init()

    def _init(self):
        def worker_thread_start():
            FooWidget.__init__(self)
            self.run()

        worker_thread = Thread(target=worker_thread_start, daemon=True)
        worker_thread.start()
```

Yep. You read that right: this class kicks off it's parent's `__init__` **to a new thread**.

So if you `close` a `FooBarWidget` instance _too quickly_, you just might do it before `FooWidget.__init__` has finished,
resulting in pain, suffering, and a deep questioning of one's life choices.

## Why, Though?

Since you might be wondering why someone would even do this, first you need to know that a `zmq.Socket` _cannot be moved between threads_,
as explained in the legendary [ZeroMQ Guide](https://zguide.zeromq.org/py:all).

To avoid blocking the main thread, `FooBarWidget` wants to let the `run` method execute in a different thread.

However, it cannot do so once `FooWidget.__init__` has been called (since the `self.consumer` socket will be created on the main thread). 

A solution, then: let both the `__init__` and the `run` execute in the new thread,
solving an annoying problem with a complete and utter disregard to sanity, common sense, and the feelings of other human beings.
